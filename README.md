<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

# üìù About The Project <a id="about-the-project"></a>

### A sample framework for automation E2E and API tests.
I have prepared several test cases to demonstrate the functionality and structure of the automation framework. My primary focus was on illustrating how to write and organize the tests, rather than on the actual testing of the application. I selected the GAD Test application, as it presents scenarios where even simple tests demand thoughtful and creative solutions.

Simple Page Object Model
Simple implementation of Page Object Model can be based on classes that represents and implements tested pages. Those classes contains locators of elements, that are used in tests, e.g. buttons, inputs etc.

Directory structure:
```
+-- Projects
|   +-- pages
|       +-- login.page.ts
|       +-- ...
|   +-- tests
|       +-- login.spac.ts
|       +-- ...
```
